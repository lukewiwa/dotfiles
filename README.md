# Wiwa's dotfiles

These dotfiles are mostly for use inside a dev container. As such it's a pretty lean set of tools and assumes that brew is already installed. This can be done in the vscode settings using the following settings:


```jsonc
{
    "dev.containers.defaultFeatures": {
        "ghcr.io/meaningful-ooo/devcontainer-features/homebrew:2": {}
    }
}
```
